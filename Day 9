Using "find" to find a file with the name of "passwords.txt"
tryhackme@linux1:~$ find -name passwords.txt
./folder1/passwords.txt
tryhackme@linux1:~$

We can use grep to search the entire contents of this file for any entries of the value that we are searching for. Going with the example of a web server's access log, we want to see everything that the IP address "81.143.211.90" has visited (note that this is fictional)

Using "grep" to find any entries with the IP address of "81.143.211.90" in "access.log"
tryhackme@linux1:~$ grep "81.143.211.90" access.log
81.143.211.90 - - [25/Mar/2021:11:17 + 0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 417 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Moto G(4))"

Symbol / Operator	Description
&	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
>	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>	
This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).

Using cat to output the "welcome" file
tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat welcome
hey

Using the >> Operator
tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo hello >> welcome
