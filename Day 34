The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis was developed by cybersecurity professionals - Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and 
Christopher Betz in 2013.

As described by its creators, the Diamond Model is composed of four core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability,
 and victim, and establishes the fundamental atomic element of any intrusion activity. You might have also noticed two additional 
components or axes of the Diamond Model - Social, Political and Technology; we will go into a little bit more detail about them later in this room. 
Why is it called a "Diamond Model"? The four core features are edge-connected, representing their underlying relationships and arranged in the shape of a diamond. 

The Diamond Model carries the essential concepts of intrusion analysis and adversary operations while allowing the 
flexibility to expand and encompass new ideas and concepts. The model provides various opportunities to integrate intelligence in real-time for network defence, automating correlation across events, classifying events with confidence into adversary campaigns, and forecasting adversary operations while planning and gaming mitigation strategies.


An adversary is also known as an attacker, enemy, cyber threat actor, or hacker. The adversary is the person who stands behind the cyberattack. Cyberattacks can be an instruction or a breach.

Adversary Operator is the “hacker” or person(s) conducting the intrusion activity.

Adversary Customer is the entity that stands to benefit from the activity conducted in the intrusion. It may be the same person who stands behind the adversary operator, 
or it may be a separate person or group.
