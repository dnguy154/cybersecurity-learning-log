Junior Security Analysts play a crucial role in the investigation procedure. They perform triaging on the ongoing alerts by exploring and 
understanding how a certain attack works and preventing bad things from happening if they can. During the investigation, 
it's important to raise the question "How? When, and why?". Security Analysts find the answers by drilling down on the data logs and alerts in 
combination with using open-source tools, 
which we will have a chance to explore later in this path.
